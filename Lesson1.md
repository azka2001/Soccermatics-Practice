Visualizing Football 
12/13 July - 2023

- Your aim for modelling data well is to boiling it down to essentials that can easily be communicated
- Creating Pass and shot maps in python - mapping the x and y coordinates on the pitch
- You can make use of valuable passes (ones with most valuable results ie goals and assists) and be able to assess and understand a certain method of play between a line of players
- Ex given - Trent Alexander Arnold’s passing map, in correlation to his valuable passes to Sadio Mane and Andy Robertson (both notibly a specific style)
- In analysis, this would allow the opposing forwards to already have an estimate on the upcoming styles of play and thus intercept the defensemen
- Examples of additional inferences you can make from shot maps for instance can be where modern strikers usually take shots for goals
- Expected Goals - Measure of the shooting angle and quality of shot (considering its possibility to lead up to a goal)
- Passing Networks - Allows you to see which players are connecting with each other, allows you to visualize the pattern of the game easily
- Heat Maps - A 2D histogram placed on a football pitch
- Touch and smoothed heat maps are not much practical
- You can analyse the defensive actions employed by managers as well for instance the before and after heat map of Jurgen Klopp’s takeover at Liverpool not only indicated that he employed a stronger defensive line but that defenders moved forward more in terms of tackling as well
- Key Performance Indices (KPIs) - We’re already aware of KPIs such as goals scored etc but in analysis for football, it’s important to deduce KPIs that enable you to understand where you’re lacking in specific instances
- For example - Expected Goals, Number of passes leading to a shot, shots in the danger zone, entries final third/box, ball recoveries within 5 seconds, passing tempo
